							<p>Are you a pregnant or new mom who's having trouble going? You're one of many. According to a survey, nearly half of new moms experience occasional constipation, and 9 in 10 had difficulty "getting things moving" in the days immediately following childbirth.<sup>1</sup></p>
							<p>Constipation during pregnancy can be caused by several factors. Hormones can relax the intestinal muscle and prevent the contraction of the muscles of the uterus, which can both lead to constipation. Anxiety, minimal amounts of exercise, and a low-fiber diet can also be contributing factors.<sup>2</sup></p><p>Pregnant women and new moms can help prevent constipation by drinking plenty of fluids and eating foods that are high in fiber. A stool softener, like Colace<sup>&reg;</sup> can also help provide comfortable relief.<sup>3</sup></p>
